        <p class="quickFade">Welcome to Hangman! This is a word-guessing game where you'll choose a category and be given a series of dashes representing a hidden word. Your goal is to guess the letters in the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn.</p>
        <p class="quickFade">To start playing, choose a category from the options provided. A random word will be selected from that category, and you'll begin the game with a blank set of dashes representing the word.</p>
        <p class="quickFade">To make a guess, simply click or tap on a letter from the alphabet provided. If the letter appears in the word, it will be revealed in the appropriate position(s). If the letter does not appear in the word, a portion of the hangman figure will be drawn.</p>
        <p class="quickFade">You have 6 guesses before the hangman is fully drawn, so choose your letters carefully! Good luck, and have fun playing Hangman.</p>
